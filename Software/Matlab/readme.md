This folder contains the codes for dynamics library generation through FROST and a standalone implementation of a scripts based simulator, an H-LIP controller and an instantaneous QP task space controller. 

Folders are organized as follow: 
1. **Animator**: contains the animation related utilities
2. **Controller**: contains the instantaneous QP task space controller 
3. **Dynamics Gen**: contains the scripts for kinematics and dynamics functions generations
4. **Expressions**: contains the generated kinematics and dynamics functions
5. **Main Walking**: contains the utilities relevant to walking

To run the simulator and controller, simply run the script named mainWalking under Main Walking folder.
